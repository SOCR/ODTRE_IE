Overview
========

This project extracts information from clinical text to generate patient level information in structured electronic health records (EHRs) format.
The proposed optimal dynamic treatment regime (DTR) estimation method is applicable for patient characterization, clinical text analysis, named entity recognition, boundary detection, and negation annotation. The derived patient characteristics are used for Tree-based Reinforcement Learning (T-RL) and estimation of multi-stage optimal DTRs. 
The *ODTRE-IE* technique is validated using simulated and clinical blood pressure EHR data.

R Code
======

The examples, demonstrations and simulations are designed, built, implemented and validated in the [R environment](https://www.r-project.org). 

The source R code for the package is in the [package (ODTRE_IE) folder](https://github.com/SOCR/ODTRE_IE/tree/master/package).
